## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the app on your device or simulator.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App

Use the Expo CLI to start the app. Run:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will launch the development server. From the output, you can choose to:

- Open the app in a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)

## Reset the Project (Optional)

If you'd like a blank slate, you can reset the project:
